# Salary-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
In this internship, we have created Salary Prediction Model with the help of various Machine Learning Models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Polynomial Regression, etc. We have majorly focused on Model Visualisation. We concluded that for our dataset, Linear Regression fits perfectly.
